Welcome to our blackjack game!

## Aim of the game
The aim of the gaim is to get to or as close to 21 points as you can without going over. If you go over 21 points, you will go bust! Each card is worth the value stated on the card, with face cards being worth 10. The only exception is the ace, which can be worth either 1 or 11 depending on your preference.

## Starting the game
When you start the game, the dealer will automatically start off by dealing himself two cards and dealing you two cards. Then, the dealer will either take a hit or stand. Taking a hit means taking another card from the deck and taking a stand is equivalent to passing a turn. Once the dealer has made their decision, you will be prompted to make yours.

## Finishing the game
Once you have reached 21 points or believe you have got as close to 21 as you can, you should decide to 'stand' and wait until the dealer has also finished their turns in order to find out who won.
